# infra-vps: Infrastructure as Code for a Dockerized VPS

This repository provides infrastructure as code to set up a new Ubuntu VPS, deploy Docker containers for various applications, and manage persistent data with a clear backup strategy.

## Getting Started (New VPS Setup)

This guide assumes you have a fresh Ubuntu server.

1.  **Log in to your new VPS** via SSH.

2.  **Clone this repository** (or your fork) to a suitable location, e.g., your home directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/infra-vps.git
    cd infra-vps
    ```

3.  **Run the bootstrap script** to install Docker, configure the firewall (UFW), and set up the necessary data directories:
    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/bootstrap.sh
    ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
    ```
    *Note: The script will add your current user to the `docker` group. You will need to log out and log back in for this change to take effect.*

4.  **Set up AnythingLLM persistent volume permissions (Crucial for AnythingLLM):**
    AnythingLLM's container expects its mounted `/app/server/storage` directory to be owned by `UID=1001` and `GID=1001`. The `bootstrap.sh` script does not set this automatically for new application volumes.
    After running `bootstrap.sh` and before starting AnythingLLM, you must manually set the correct permissions:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /srv/anythingllm/storage
    sudo chown -R 1001:1001 /srv/anythingllm
    sudo chmod -R 777 /srv/anythingllm/storage
    ```
    This ensures the `anythingllm` container has the necessary read/write access to its persistent storage volume.

5.  **Log out and log back in** to your VPS.

6.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment files and modify them as needed:
    ```bash
    cp docker/n8n/.env.example docker/n8n/.env
    cp docker/openwebui/.env.example docker/openwebui/.env
    # Edit the .env files with your specific settings (e.g., N8N_HOST)
    nano docker/n8n/.env
    nano docker/openwebui/.env
    ```

## Security Setup (Optional but Recommended)

For a new VPS, it is best practice to create a non-root sudo user and disable root login. A helper script is provided:

1.  **Run the security setup script:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/setup-security.sh
    sudo ./scripts/setup-security.sh
    ```
    This interactive script will:
    *   Create a new user (you specify the name).
    *   Add the user to `sudo` and `docker` groups.
    *   Copy your current root SSH keys to the new user.
    *   (Optionally) Disable root login and password authentication in SSH.

2.  **Verify access:** Open a new terminal and try to SSH in as the new user *before* closing your current session.

## Docker Applications

This setup includes `docker-compose.yml` configurations for the following applications:

*   **n8n:** Workflow automation (docker/n8n/docker-compose.yml)
*   **Open WebUI:** A user interface for Ollama (docker/openwebui/docker-compose.yml)
*   **Nginx Proxy Manager:** For easy reverse proxy and SSL certificate management (docker/proxy/docker-compose.yml)

## Persistent Data Structure

All important persistent data generated by the Docker applications lives in predictable host folders under `/srv`:

*   `/srv/n8n/data`: n8n configuration and internal data.
*   `/srv/ollama/data`: Ollama model data.
*   `/srv/openwebui/data`: Open WebUI application data.
*   `/srv/nginx/data`: Nginx Proxy Manager configuration, database, and custom certificates.
*   `/srv/nginx/letsencrypt`: Let's Encrypt certificates managed by Nginx Proxy Manager.

## Backup Strategy

It is CRITICAL to regularly back up the `/srv` directory to a location *not* on this VPS. This ensures your data is safe in case of server failure.

**Recommended Backup Method:** Use `rsync` or a cloud-based backup solution to periodically sync `/srv` to a remote server, object storage (e.g., S3, Backblaze B2), or a dedicated backup service.

Example `rsync` command (run from your backup server):
```bash
# rsync -avh --delete user@your-vps-ip:/srv/ /path/to/your/backup/location/latest/srv/
```

## Restore Ritual (One-Command Restore)

In case of a new VPS setup or data loss, you can restore your application data using the `restore-data.sh` script.

1.  **Ensure your backup data is accessible** on the VPS (e.g., mounted at `/mnt/backup/latest`).

2.  **Run the restore script:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/restore-data.sh
    ./scripts/restore-data.sh
    ```
    *Note: You will need to uncomment and adjust the `rsync` commands within `restore-data.sh` to match your backup source.*

3.  **Start your Docker containers** after restoration:
    ```bash
    cd docker/n8n && docker compose up -d
    cd ../openwebui && docker compose up -d
    cd ../proxy && docker compose up -d
    # Or start all at once if they are in the same directory and you are in infra-vps/docker
    # docker compose -f n8n/docker-compose.yml -f openwebui/docker-compose.yml -f proxy/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

## Usage

Once the setup is complete and `.env` files are configured, navigate to the respective application's directory and start the Docker containers:

```bash
cd docker/n8n
docker compose up -d

cd ../openwebui
docker compose up -d

cd ../proxy
docker compose up -d
```

To stop them:

```bash
cd docker/n8n
docker compose down
# ...and so on for other applications
```
